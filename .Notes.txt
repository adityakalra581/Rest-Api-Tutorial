2. flask_marshmallow:

pip install flask-marshmallow
reference: https://flask-marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/

3. Connecting sqlalchemy and marshmallow:

pip install marshmallow-sqlalchemy

TIP: Dont follow the tutorial blindly
     read the errors and rectify those accordingly.

1. app.py: 

- can get login(Specific for specific id)

- can get all the logins (Everything till now)

- can post data and fetch it accordingly.

*******************

Using Postman to test api:

1. Download and install it: i have directly installed it from the store in ubuntu.

2. Need to create a request therefore and paste the url of flask server.

3. then use the method like GET,POST,DELETE and so on.
